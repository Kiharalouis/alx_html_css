# Project Title: HTML Webpage Implementation - Pure HTML Semantic

## Task Brief

In this project, my task is to implement a webpage from a designer file, focusing solely on the HTML structure. I will not be dealing with CSS or styling in this project, but instead, my goal is to create a solid foundation using pure HTML semantics.

## Project Overview

The HTML Webpage Implementation project provides an opportunity for me to sharpen my HTML skills and learn how to translate a designer's vision into a structured HTML document. By focusing exclusively on the HTML structure, I will gain a deeper understanding of semantic markup and the importance of organizing content effectively.

## Task Details

1. Study the designer file provided to understand the overall layout and structure of the webpage.
2. Identify the various sections, elements, and components that need to be implemented in HTML.
3. Create an HTML file using my preferred code editor.
4. Implement the necessary HTML tags and attributes to replicate the structure of the webpage.
5. Ensure the HTML follows best practices for semantic markup, utilizing appropriate tags for each section and content type.
6. Pay attention to the hierarchy of elements and maintain a logical structure throughout the document.
7. Use placeholder content, such as lorem ipsum text, to represent the actual content that will be added later.
8. Validate my HTML code using online tools or browser extensions to ensure compliance with standards.
9. Test the structure of the webpage by previewing it in a web browser to verify that the desired layout is achieved.

Remember, the primary focus of this project is on the HTML structure, not the visual appearance. By mastering the art of semantic markup, I will lay a solid foundation for future projects that involve styling and CSS.

## Submission

Once I have completed the HTML structure implementation, submit your project by:

1. Saving the HTML file with an appropriate name.
2. Compressing the HTML file and any associated assets into a single archive (ZIP or other common format).
3. Uploading the compressed file to the designated submission platform.

## Conclusion

By successfully completing this project, I will have developed a strong understanding of semantic HTML markup and the importance of structuring webpages effectively. This foundational knowledge will serve as a valuable building block for future projects involving CSS styling, interactivity, and more.

Good luck to me, and enjoy the process of bringing a designer's vision to life through pure HTML semantics!
